Desktop application which shows usage of algorithms in pathfinding (A*, UCS, BFS), more info in README

One of my first little bit more complex projects, I built it for purpose of Silesian University course.

It is written in C# using WPF technology but due to the lack of experience in that time I didn't use any
design patterns like MVVM, to help organise the code, main point was to introduce pathfinding algorithms, in
graphical way so to let anyone to test it by himself, and I think this goal was achived.

I gained certificate and what is more important I made myself familiar with widly used algorithms like A* or Dijkstra,
also some of them (A*, BFS, UCS) I implemented from scratch in order to better understand their structure.
